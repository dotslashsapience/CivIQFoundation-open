## **‚è≥ Soon After Launch (Planned Enhancements)**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Fact-Checking & Misinformation Prevention**
- **Automated fact-checking system integrated into the algorithm**.
- **Context labels for flagged content rather than direct removal**.
- **Misinformation Trust Score ‚Äì Users with repeated violations lose reach & voting power.**

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Expert & Journalist Badges**
- **Verified credentials for experts, journalists, and professionals**.
- **Identity-based trust signals to enhance credibility**.

- **Allows decentralized identity verification while maintaining user privacy.**
- **Users can log in using existing decentralized identity services.**
- **Alternative to requiring phone numbers/Gov IDs.**

### **9Ô∏è‚É£ Web of Trust Verification Model**
- **Rather than centralized KYC, users can be verified via peer-to-peer reputation scores.**
- **Ensures community-based trust-building while preventing fake accounts.**

### **üîü Post Visibility Transparency Panel**
- **Users can see why their posts rank higher or lower in the feed.**
- **Transparency dashboard explains algorithmic decisions.**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Portable User Data & Decentralized Backups**
