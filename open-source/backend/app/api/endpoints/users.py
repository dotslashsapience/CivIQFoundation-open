'''# TODOs for users.py

- **Implement User Registration Endpoint (`create_user`)**
  - [ ] Validate incoming registration data using Pydantic schemas (e.g., `UserCreate`).
  - [ ] Check for existing user conflicts (e.g., duplicate email or username).
  - [ ] Call the `user_service.create_user()` function to handle the business logic.
  - [ ] Return appropriate HTTP responses for successful registration and error cases.
  - [ ] Add proper logging for user registration events.

- **Implement User Login Endpoint (`login_user`)**
  - [ ] Validate login credentials using the corresponding Pydantic schema (e.g., `UserLogin`).
  - [ ] Authenticate user via the `user_service.login_user()` function.
  - [ ] Generate and return an authentication token (JWT or similar).
  - [ ] Handle common error scenarios (invalid credentials, account not found, etc.).
  - [ ] Log authentication attempts and failures for security auditing.

- **Implement Get User Profile Endpoint (`get_user_profile`)**
  - [ ] Extract user identity from the authentication token or session.
  - [ ] Retrieve user profile data from the database via the `user_service.get_user_profile()` function.
  - [ ] Format and return the user profile using the `UserOut` schema.
  - [ ] Implement error handling for cases such as unauthorized access or missing profile data.

- **General Enhancements**
  - [ ] Integrate dependency injection for database sessions and configuration settings.
  - [ ] Ensure proper error handling with custom exception classes where necessary.
  - [ ] Write unit tests for each endpoint to validate behavior and edge cases.
  - [ ] Add inline documentation and comments to improve code readability.
  - [ ] Verify that all endpoints follow FastAPI best practices (e.g., proper use of decorators and dependencies).

- **Security Considerations**
  - [ ] Implement rate limiting if needed to prevent brute-force login attempts.
  - [ ] Ensure that all sensitive data is handled securely (e.g., hashing passwords, secure token storage).

- **Code Review and Refactoring**
  - [ ] Schedule a review of the endpoints after implementation for further improvements.
  - [ ] Refactor common functionality into utility functions if patterns are repeated across endpoints.
