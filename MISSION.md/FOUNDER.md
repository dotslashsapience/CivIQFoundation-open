# 🏛️ About the Founder: The Vision Behind CivIQ

## **👋 Meet the Founder**
### **Chris** – A Veteran, Technologist, and Civic Innovator

I am a **12-year U.S. Army veteran**, a **computer science student**, and the **founder of CivIQ**, a mission-driven social platform designed to restore **truthful, constructive discourse** in an era where social media has contributed to **division, misinformation, and political dysfunction**.

I have **first-hand experience in leadership, project management, and problem-solving** from my military service, and while I am still advancing my technical skills, I make up for it with **vision, execution, and strategic planning**. My mission with CivIQ is simple: **to build a better social media platform that prioritizes integrity, transparency, and meaningful engagement over profit-driven outrage and manipulation.**

## **🚨 Why I Started CivIQ**
Like many Americans, I have been **appalled by how social media has torn this country apart**. Instead of bringing people together, platforms like Facebook, Twitter (X), and YouTube have:
- **Amplified misinformation & radicalized users** through engagement-driven algorithms.
- **Encouraged political polarization** by reinforcing ideological echo chambers.
- **Silenced meaningful discourse** in favor of outrage-driven content.
- **Exploited users for profit**, prioritizing ad revenue over truth and ethical responsibility.

I knew that **complaining about the problem wasn’t enough**—we needed an **alternative solution** built from the ground up with **mission-aligned values, algorithmic transparency and community-driven governance**. That’s where CivIQ was born.
