# 🏛️ CivIQ Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **CivIQ**, a censorship-resistant civic discourse platform designed to foster high-quality discussions while maintaining transparency, privacy, and resilience against censorship. This document outlines **guidelines for contributing to both open-source and closed-source components**, along with the **requirements to gain access to restricted repositories**.

---

## **🌍 Our Mission**
CivIQ exists to **fix the failures of modern social media** by building an algorithmically transparent, decentralized, and mission-driven alternative that prioritizes:
✅ **High-quality, evidence-based discussions** over engagement-driven content.
✅ **Algorithmic transparency** and user control.
✅ **Misinformation resistance** without authoritarian censorship.
✅ **Censorship resistance** via decentralized hosting and governance.

Every contribution to CivIQ must align with this mission. Contributors to **closed-source components** will be **thoroughly vetted for mission alignment and technical qualifications**.

---

## **📜 Code of Conduct**
All contributors are expected to adhere to the following principles:
- **Respect & Professionalism** – Treat all contributors with dignity.
- **Constructive Feedback** – Focus on solutions, not just problems.
- **Privacy & Security** – Never share sensitive project details outside of encrypted channels.
- **Mission Alignment** – Ensure all contributions uphold CivIQ’s goals.

---

## **🔓 Open-Source Contribution Guidelines**
Anyone can contribute to the **open-source components** of CivIQ, which include:
- **Frontend UI & UX Components**
- **Public API Documentation**
- **Community Discussion Tools**
- **Localization & Accessibility Features**
- **Public Issue & Bug Fixes**

### **1️⃣ Technical Requirements for Open-Source Contributions**
#### **Git & Repository Standards**
- All commits must be **GPG signed**.
- Follow the **Conventional Commits** format:
  - Example: `feat(ui): improved comment section`
- Keep pull requests **focused on a single logical change**.
- Ensure code is **clean, maintainable, and well-documented**.

#### **Pull Request (PR) Workflow**
1. Fork the repo & create a feature branch.
2. Ensure your code follows CivIQ’s coding standards.
3. Write **unit tests** for new functionality.
4. Submit a PR with a **clear description of your changes**.
5. Pass all automated security checks.
6. Address feedback from maintainers before merge approval.

#### **Security & Privacy Considerations**
- Report vulnerabilities to **security@civiq.us** (not as public issues).
- Never commit **secrets, API keys, or user data**.
- Ensure your contributions **do not introduce tracking mechanisms**.

## **🔒 Closed-Source Contribution Requirements**
CivIQ maintains a set of **restricted repositories** for security-critical, misinformation-resistance, and anti-manipulation tools. These components include:

🔐 **Ranking Algorithm** – Prevents engagement-driven manipulation.
🔐 **Moderation Tools** – AI-assisted misinformation detection.
🔐 **Bot Detection System** – AI & behavior-based bot filtering.
🔐 **Identity Verification** – Cryptographic proof-of-humanity systems.
🔐 **Censorship Resistance Infrastructure** – Decentralized hosting tools.

### **1️⃣ Who Can Contribute to Closed-Source Components?**
Due to the sensitive nature of these systems, contributors must undergo a **strict vetting process**. To gain access, you must:
✅ **Demonstrate technical expertise** in AI, cybersecurity, cryptography, or distributed systems.
✅ **Show past contributions** to privacy-focused or open-source civic engagement projects.
✅ **Undergo a mission alignment review** to ensure CivIQ’s core values are upheld.
✅ **Sign a Contributor Agreement & NDA** to protect sensitive components.
✅ **Pass an internal security review** before repository access is granted.

### **2️⃣ Access Process for Closed-Source Components**
1. **Submit a request to `founder@civiq.us`** detailing your experience.
2. **Provide links to past work**, GitHub repositories, or open-source contributions.
3. **Pass a code review test** assigned by CivIQ maintainers.
4. **Complete an onboarding interview** to verify mission alignment.
5. **Sign the Contributor Agreement** before gaining access.
6. **Join an encrypted communication channel** for ongoing collaboration.

### **3️⃣ Stringent Contribution Standards for Closed-Source Work**
Because these systems are security-sensitive, all closed-source contributions must:
- **Undergo a multi-stage peer review process.**
- **Follow zero-trust coding principles** to prevent backdoors or exploits.
- **Be tested against adversarial attack scenarios.**
- **Pass strict security & cryptography audits** before deployment.

🚨 **Contributors who violate trust, leak sensitive information, or fail to align with CivIQ’s mission will have access revoked permanently.**
