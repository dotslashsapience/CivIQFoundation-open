# CivIQ

CivIQ is a civic engagement platform designed to foster meaningful political discourse and educate citizens on policy topics. Our mission is to humanize online discussions by requiring verified identities for all users—eliminating anonymous posting—and promoting transparency and accountability in civic dialogue.

CivIQ follows a hybrid open-source model:
- **Core functionalities** (discussion platform, basic feed algorithms, standard moderation, etc.) are open-source under the AGPL license.
- **Premium features** (advanced analytics, customizable feeds, enhanced moderation tools, etc.) remain proprietary to support long-term sustainability.

## Repository Structure

This repository focuses on the **open-source core** of CivIQ. We recommend separating premium functionalities into a private repository. The core repository includes:

- **Backend (`backend/`):**  
  Contains the FastAPI application with core endpoints for user authentication, discussion management, and basic moderation.
  - `app/api/endpoints/`: Core API endpoints (e.g., users, posts, comments).
  - `app/core/`: Application configuration and database connection setup.
  - `app/models/`: ORM models for users, posts, votes, etc.
  - `app/schemas/`: Pydantic schemas for request/response validation.
  - `app/services/`: Business logic for core functionalities (e.g., point tracking).
  - `app/utils/`: Helper functions (e.g., token generation, hashing).
  - `tests/`: Unit and integration tests.
  - `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
  - `Dockerfile`: Container setup for the backend.

- **Frontend (`frontend/`):**  
  Contains the React application that interfaces with the backend.
  - `public/`: Static files (e.g., `index.html`).
  - `src/components/`: Reusable UI components (e.g., NavBar, PostList).
  - `src/pages/`: Page-level components (e.g., Home, Profile, Discussion).
  - `src/services/`: Functions to interact with the backend API.
  - `src/hooks/`: Custom React hooks (e.g., `useAuth`).
  - `src/utils/`: Utility functions (e.g., date formatting).
  - `src/styles/`: Global CSS/Sass files and themes.
  - `src/assets/`: Static assets (images, icons, including the CivIQ logo).
  - `package.json`: Frontend dependencies and scripts.

- **Infrastructure (`infrastructure/`):**  
  Contains deployment configurations and scripts.
  - `docker/`: Docker Compose files for multi-container setups.
  - `nginx/`: NGINX configurations for reverse proxy.
  - `k8s/`: Kubernetes manifests/Helm charts for orchestration.
  - `terraform/`: Infrastructure-as-code scripts for cloud provisioning.

- **Documentation (`docs/`):**  
  Contains detailed documentation such as system architecture, API docs, and the product roadmap.
